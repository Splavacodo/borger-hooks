Borger is a web application that is managed by React and Redux. Borger is a single page application. The application offers the user to build a burger with the variety of ingredients offered to them. As they click the buttons to add ingredients, the app dynamically displays them to the users thanks to React. Redux is used to handle async code for the orders and ingredients using a middleware called react-thunk. The application has an authentication page to handle users coming into the website. As well as specific views depending on whether the user is authenticated. This version only contains functional components by using React Hooks.
